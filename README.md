# A_Simple_Web_Scraper
A simple project of applying web scraping on a company review website.

## Project Description
1. Applied `BeautifulSoup` to extract `companyName`, `datePublished`, `ratingValue` and `reviewBody` from a company review website.
2. Built a function `get_last_page_num` to get the page number of the last web page of the company reviews.
3. Built a conditional for loop to iterate all web pages and extract necessary information.
4. Export the extracted information as a `csv` file and save it to local.
